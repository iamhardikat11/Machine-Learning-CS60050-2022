## Question 1
 

### Directions to use the code  
1. Download this directory into your local machine

2. Copy the Dataset_A.csv file in the Source Code Directory

3. Ensure all the necessary dependencies with required version and latest version of Python3 are available (verify with `requirements.txt`)  <br>
 `pip3 install -r requirements1.txt`

4. Run specific solution to problem with the aid of `q1.py` <br>
 `python3 q1.py`

5. The image of the final decision tree will be created in the same directory as the Source Code.

6. All the Output will be generated in a file named `output1.txt`


## Question 2
 

### Directions to use the code  
1. Download this directory into your local machine

2. Copy the Dataset_A.csv file in the Source Code Directory

3. Ensure all the necessary dependencies with required version and latest version of Python3 are available (verify with `requirements.txt`)  <br>
 `pip3 install -r requirements2.txt`

4. Run specific solution to problem with the aid of `q2.py` <br>
 `python3 q2.py`

5. The image of the final decision tree will be created in the same directory as the Source Code.

6. All the Output will be generated in a file named `output2.txt`
